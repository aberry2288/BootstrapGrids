                    <p>North Carolina (/ˌkærəˈlaɪnə/ (listen)) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United
                        States.
                        The state is the 28th largest and 9th-most populous of the United States. It is bordered by
                        Virginia
                        to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Georgia and South Carolina to the south, and
                        Tennessee
                        to the west. In the 2020 census, the state had a population of 10,439,388.[7] Raleigh is the
                        state's
                        capital and Charlotte is its largest city. The Charlotte metropolitan area, with a population of
                        2,595,027 in 2020,[8] is the most-populous metropolitan area in North Carolina, the 21st-most
                        populous in the United States, and the largest banking center in the nation after New York
                        City.[9]
                        The Raleigh-Durham-Cary combined statistical area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the
                        state and 32nd-most populous in the United States, with a population of 2,043,867 in 2020,[10]
                        and
                        is home to the largest research park in the United States, Research Triangle Park.

                        The earliest evidence of human occupation in North Carolina dates back 10,000 years, found at
                        the
                        Hardaway Site. North Carolina was inhabited by Carolina Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan
                        speaking
                        tribes of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans. King Charles II granted eight lord
                        proprietors a colony they named Carolina after the king and which was established in 1670 with
                        the
                        first permanent settlement at Charles Town (Charleston). Because of the difficulty of governing
                        the
                        entire colony from Charles Town, the colony was eventually divided and North Carolina was
                        established as a royal colony in 1729 and was one of the Thirteen Colonies. In 1755, colonial
                        North
                        Carolina received its first postmaster, James Davis, appointed by Benjamin Franklin.[11] The
                        Halifax
                        Resolves resolution adopted by North Carolina on April 12, 1776, was the first formal call for
                        independence from Great Britain among the American Colonies during the American Revolution.[12]

                        On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the United States
                        Constitution.
                        In the run-up to the American Civil War, North Carolina declared its secession from the Union on
                        May
                        20, 1861, becoming the tenth of eleven states to join the Confederate States of America.
                        Following
                        the Civil War, the state was restored to the Union on July 4, 1868.[13] On December 17, 1903,
                        Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully piloted the world's first controlled, sustained flight of
                        a
                        powered, heavier-than-air aircraft at Kitty Hawk in North Carolina's Outer Banks. North Carolina
                        often uses the slogan "First in Flight" on state license plates to commemorate this achievement,
                        alongside a newer alternative design bearing the slogan "First in Freedom" in reference to the
                        Mecklenburg Declaration and Halifax Resolves.

                        North Carolina is defined by a wide range of elevations and landscapes. From west to east, North
                        Carolina's elevation descends from the Appalachian Mountains to the Piedmont and Atlantic
                        coastal
                        plain. North Carolina's Mount Mitchell at 6,684 ft (2,037 m) is the highest point in North
                        America
                        east of the Mississippi River.[14] Most of the state falls in the humid subtropical climate
                        zone;
                        however, the western, mountainous part of the state has a subtropical highland climate.[15]</p>
